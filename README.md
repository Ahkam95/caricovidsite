Please note, this was quickly put together( so it's very hacky :) ) at the request of a journalist, who needed a more focused view on the Caribbean COVID Situation.

Data source is the CSV files updated semi-regularly by the Johns Hopkins University.
To fill in the gaps of the Johns Hopkins data, I have a separate also public repository where I update only the cases that I want to increase on the site.

Please use your own mapbox API when running this locally or elsewhere.
Pull requests & issues welcome.

Have fun :)
