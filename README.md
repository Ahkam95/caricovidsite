This project was started on the request of a journalist, who needed a more focused view on the Caribbean COVID Situation.

Data source is the CSV files updated once per day by the Johns Hopkins University.
To fill in the gaps of the Johns Hopkins data, I have a separate also public repository where I update only the cases that I want to increase on the site.

Please use your own mapbox API when running this locally or elsewhere.
Pull requests & issues welcome.

Have fun :)
